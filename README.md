# Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis project! This project aims to leverage data science techniques to diagnose heart disease based on various medical attributes. With an emphasis on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualization, this project provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart disease.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize heart disease data to identify patterns and correlations. The project includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Importing the dataset, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution of variables and their relationships with heart disease.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Converting numerical data to categorical data for better insights.
4. **Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the data better.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and more, along with a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Key Findings
- **Gender and Heart Disease**: Visualization shows a higher prevalence of heart disease among males.
- **Age Distribution**: Older individuals tend to have a higher risk of heart disease.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Elevated cholesterol levels are strongly correlated with heart disease.
- **Maximum Heart Rate**: Lower maximum heart rates are associated with higher incidences of heart disease.

## Visualizations
Some of the key visualizations included in this project are:
- **Distribution of Heart Disease**: A count plot showing the number of individuals with and without heart disease.
- **Heart Disease by Gender**: A count plot comparing the prevalence of heart disease between males and females.
- **Age Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of ages among individuals with and without heart disease.
- **Cholesterol vs. Age**: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between age and cholesterol levels, differentiated by heart disease status.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For any machine learning models applied in the project.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of heart disease data, offering insights that can help in the early diagnosis and prevention of heart disease. By leveraging data science techniques, we can better understand the factors contributing to heart disease and improve healthcare outcomes.
